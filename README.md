==============================================

These are my collection of notes for the book

for an introductory course in abstract algebra. I use them to look up
definitions, theorems and tricks.

Requirements to build

Just use either of TeX Live or MacTeX, and you should have all the packages. I
also upload a PDF for every commit.
